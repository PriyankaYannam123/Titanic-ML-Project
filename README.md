Titanic Survival Prediction Project
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset and predicts passenger survival using machine learning models. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and implementation of classification models like Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The models are further optimized using cross-validation.

Project Overview
The Titanic dataset from Kaggle is a widely used dataset in machine learning. The goal is to classify passengers as survived or deceased based on features such as age, sex, passenger class, and more.

Key highlights of the project:

Data preprocessing to handle missing values, categorical encoding, and feature selection.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns in the dataset.
Implementation of Logistic Regression and SVM models.
Model optimization using cross-validation techniques.
